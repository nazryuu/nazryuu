Heyya there! Why are you here... Are you secretly stalking me...? Just kidding! ᐠ(ᐛ)ᐟ

☆⁠ Now that you're here, let me introduce myself! You can call me Kei, Naz or Ryuu, but feel free to call me anything that you're more comfortable with~

☆⁠ I speak malay and english, though I can understand Indonesian, there's some words that I'm not familiar with sadly (´。＿。｀)                                                                                        
(Still learning arabic btw!)

• Usually I sit alone or with friends, if I'm with someone, I prefer you not to approach me please.                                                                                                                    
• I don't mind any C+H~                                                                                                                                                                                                
• I'm a bit shy, so sometimes I get too quiet-                                                                                                                                                                         
• Most importantly, I'm dumb at socializing. It's a warning if you hate any awkward moment!                                                                                                                            
• I won't tolerate any dating request.
